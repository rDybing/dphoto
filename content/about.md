As a rather mature programmer, there is a lot of sitting, inside, staring into a screen. Not very healthy.

So to motivate myself to get out and about on a regular basis, I got my self a decent camera, and started doing long walks and taking photos on a semi-regular basis. At least thrice a week.

Yes, I could have gotten a dog - problem is - I prefer cats ðŸ˜º

Mostly do street photography, snapping photos of what catches my eye.

### Gear

**For when nice and dry:**

- Canon EOS R100
- 16mm F2.8
- 18-45mm F4.5-6.3
- 50mm F1.8
- 55-210mm F5-7.1

Mind you, when going for a walkabout, I mount the lens I am in the mood for, and won't carry around any others. Puts restrictions on what I can shoot, but restrictions are good!

Oh, and the R100 being a APS-C crop sensor camera - multiply the Focal Length of the lenses by 1.6 for the Full Frame equivalent. The petite size of the camera body and the smaller lighter lenses make for a very good Street Photo combo.

**For when wet and miserable:**

- Kodak Pixpro WPZ2 27-108mm F3-6.6

Not Weather Sealed, oh no - Watertight is more like it. Down to 15 Meters. Not that I do any swimming, but the weather here in Bergen can at times be like standing under a shower...

Yes, not quite the same versatility as the Canon camera, and certainly not the same level of control. No adjusting aperture for instance, that goes up and down with zoom. Oh, and no RAW files, JPEG only. Quality is decent enough straight out of camera however - assuming daylight and outdoors.
